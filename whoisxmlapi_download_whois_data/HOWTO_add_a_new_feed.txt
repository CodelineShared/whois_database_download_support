For developers/testers:

how to add a new feed

1. Open feeds.ini with your favourite programming text editor

2. Add a new section (to a logical place) with the section name

feed__dataformat

Note: as ini files do not support hierarchy, you will need a record
for each dataformat. Take care that the common data should be similar.

See the examples already there.

3. Fill the required feeds according to the already added feeds. In
file names you can use the follwing strings which will be substituted:
     $dbversion: quarterly database version, e.g. 'v6' or 'v20'
     $date: date string for daily feeds, e.g. '2017_08_20'
     $minusdate: date string for daily feeds in the format e.g. '2017-08-20'
     $_date: date string preceded by an underscore, e.g. '_2017_08_20'
     $tld: tld, e.g. 'com' or 'ac.at'
     $tldunderscore: tld string, dots replaced by underscores, e.g. 'ac_at' for
     		     'ac.at'
     $filename: a file name. Used in file masks which are derived from files such as md5mask
     $ALLFILES: all files of the directory. Typically for subdirectories with csvs.
