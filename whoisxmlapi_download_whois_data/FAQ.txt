Q1: I  obtained an  error  stating that  my login  and password  are
invalid. I can access the page with my browser. What happened?

A1:  It might be  the case  that you have  specified a wrong  date or
database version. E.g. you chose v20 of quarterly cctld feeds when the
last version is v8. As the script  does not have data on the available
db  versions,  it  derives  file  locations from  the  data  you  have
specified,  but these  locations  do  not exist  on  our server.   For
security reasons the server will  report invalid login credentials, so
it will appear as if there was something wrong with your password.

Please double-check the feed name and the parameters you are using.

Q2: The  script  says  it cannot  determine  the  list of  supported
tlds. Why?

A2: In spite  of all of our efforts it may  happen that the necessary
supported_tlds file is missing. Please contact support in this case.

Q3:  The   script  reports   files  which   could  not   have  been
downloaded. When shall they be available?

A3: It  may happen  that some  files derived  according to  the naming
logic of a  given feed do not  exist at the time  of downloading. One
reason might  be that the  file is not yet  prepared when you  run the
script. If  you re-run the script  later with the same  parameters, it
will not  redownload files which are  already there and have  not been
changed, but  it shall find the  missing ones. It may  also occur that
the   file  will   never   exist.   In   feeds   devoted  to   changes
(domain_names_new,  domain_names_dropped),  for   instance,  it  might
happen that there were no changes in the data the given day. We do not
store empty files, so these files will be reported as unavailable, but
this is normal.
